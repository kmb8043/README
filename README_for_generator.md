# README Generator #

## Description ##

For this project I wanted to create a professional README within the terminal using prompts. 

The user will receive prompts asking questions pertaining to a professional README. 

These prompts will ask about the users title, description,etc.

The responses will then be inserted into a markdown template and submited as a new folder, named README. 

## Instalation ##

The user will run "node index.js" in the working terminal of the project. The user will need to answer the prompts in order to get the README. 

## Usage ##

The user can use this generator to create a readme file through the terminal.

## GitHub ##
